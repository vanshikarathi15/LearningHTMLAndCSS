        <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
        </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>INLINE CSS:</dt>
                <dd>by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</dd>
                <dt>INTERNAL CSS:</dt>
                <dd>by using a style element in the head section</dd>
                <dt>EXTERNAL CSS:</dt>
                <dd>by using a link  element to link to an external CSS file</dd>
            </dl>
        
        <h2>Here we will apply external CSS </h2>
        <p>
            External CSS. The external style sheet is generally used when you want to make changes on multiple pages. It is ideal for this condition because it facilitates you to change the look of the entire web site by changing just one file.
            Since now that you understand that the CSS rules can be defined at multiple places using various techniques, what do you think will happen when an element in HTML has more than one CSS rule? Which properties will finally be applied to that element while displaying? To solve this, CSS defines a specific order which decides the winning selectors. This order is known as the cascading order which is where the 'cascading' in CSS is derived.
            The list below is ordered by weight with the highest weight first:

            1) Importance

            2) Specificity

            3) Source order

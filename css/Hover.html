        The internal and external CSS are treated equally by the browser. But the order of their
definition decides which oneâ€™s property will get preference.
If link to external CSS is defined before the internal CSS, then properties of internal CSS will
get the preference, i.e internal CSS > external CSS.
If link to external CSS is defined after the internal CSS, then properties of external CSS will get
preference over internal CSS, i.e. external CSS > internal CSS.

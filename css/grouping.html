        It is most of the time that we use same css for multiple elements and we can't use
too much classes. This would bring classes without any meaning in the scenario and
would become difficult to manage. So, CSS provides with a grouping feature where you can apply CSS rules to multiple
elements with the use of combination of either tag, class or id. For grouping, we use
comma between the different selectors.

    <h2>
        there are 4 kind of grouping:
    </h2>
    <ol id="padding">
        <li>descendant selector</li>
        <li>child selector</li>
        <li>adjacent sibling selector</li>
        <li>general sibling selector</li>
    </ol>
